**2SpaceMasterRace** *( also known as Harii )* is a Student of Electrical and Computer Engineering *@* **Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham**

As a Future Creative Developer 🚀, I'm on the journey of finding my place in that warm, uncanny, funky world between design and development.To find the *ithaka* where the most fun, creative, boundary-breaking magic happens 

Make yourself at home, nothing much to see here *( I consider this as art , so feel free to look at it as much time as you wantt )*  as it's under constant construction but hey, *Mi casa es tu casa*
