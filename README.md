### About Me  :

Hi ! I'm Hari Varsha, better known as vxsha-256 / nanodijkstra around the internet.


I like to work on cool stuff such as storage engines, distributed systems, machine learning infrastructure & such. I'm a big fan of optimizing developer workflows, craft blazingly fast projects that just work and understand computer systems deeper to unlock the secrets of the universe.


Previously @ USCS ( Go Slugs! ), Upcoming Grad school Student (hopefully) specalizing in systems programming. Based on Bengaluru, India.
