### About Me  :

Currently pursuing Electrical and Computer Engineering *@* **Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham** and exploring art, mathematics, electrical and software engineering full-time diving head first into everything.


As an aspiring creative developer & system engineer, I build highly performant beautiful projects spending nights and weekends to ensure perfection. I completely love to work on cool ( & relatively dumb ) things and expand my boundaries to spice things up.

Available August 2023.
