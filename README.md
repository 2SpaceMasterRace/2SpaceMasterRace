### About Me  :

Hi ! I'm Hari Varsha, better known as vxsha-256 / nanodijkstra around the internet.


I like to work on cool stuff such as storage engines, distributed systems, machine learning infrastructure & such. I'm a big fan of optimizing developer workflows, craft blazingly-fast projects ( that just work ) and understand computer systems deeper to unlock the secrets of the universe.


Previously @ UCSC ( Go Slugs! ) and now an upcoming grad school student ( hopefully ) specializing in systems programming. 

Based in Bengaluru, India.
