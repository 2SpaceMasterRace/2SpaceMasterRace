### About Me  :

Hi ! I'm Hari Varsha V, better known as nanodijkstra around the internet.


I like to work on cool stuff such as storage engines, distributed systems, machine learning infrastructure & such. I'm a big fan of optimizing developer workflows, craft blazingly-fast projects ( that just work ) and understand computer systems deeper to unlock the secrets of the universe.


Previously Summer Intern @ UCSC ( Go Slugs! ) and now an upcoming grad school student @ NYU Tandon. 

Based in Bengaluru, India.
